## Summary
This codebase implements a simple Task Manager application with the following main components and interactions:

1. Task: Represents individual tasks with title and description.

2. TaskManager: Manages a list of tasks, allowing adding, viewing, and completing tasks.

3. UserInterface: Handles displaying the menu and getting user input.

4. Main function: 
   - Creates instances of TaskManager and UserInterface
   - Runs a loop to:
     - Display the menu
     - Get user choice
     - Perform actions based on the choice (view tasks, add task, complete task, or exit)

The application allows users to interact with a task list through a command-line interface, enabling them to view, add, and complete tasks until they choose to exit the program.

## Steps to Run the Code

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save all the necessary files (app.py, task.py, task_manager.py, user_interface.py) in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.
4. Run the application by executing the following command:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Task Manager application.
