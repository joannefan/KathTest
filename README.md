## Summary
This code base implements a simple Task Manager application. It allows users to view tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and exit the application.

## Installation
The code does not appear to require any external dependencies or libraries to be installed, as it only imports modules from the same project (task, task_manager, user_interface).

## Steps to Run the Code
To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Save the provided code in a file named `app.py`.
3. Create two additional files: `task.py` and `user_interface.py`, and implement the `Task` class and `user_interface` class respectively.
4. Run the `app.py` file using Python, e.g., `python app.py`.
5. The Task Manager application will start, and you can interact with it by selecting options from the menu.
